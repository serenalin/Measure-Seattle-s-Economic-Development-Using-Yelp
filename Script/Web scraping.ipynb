       "  'reviews': [\"Met a friend for Sunday brunch, and she chose Salare. What a lovely spot! From the moment you walk in, it has a very 'brunch' feel (if that makes sense). Loved the clean and fresh decor as well. For brunch we started with the french toast with jam and creme fraiche - so good! The french toast was melt in your mouth (with the perfect amount of crispiness). \\xa0I also had the quiche ( again - the perfect crust - I do love me some crispiness ;)). My friend had the mushroom ragou which was very hearty. \\xa0Parking can be difficult - it's in a residential-ly area so some tight streets and limited street parking. But I would love to come back for dinner - Ravenna is such a cozy little neighborhood!\",\n",
       "   \"We came here to celebrate the birthday boy's big day and had a great dinner made possible by the friendly staff, attention to plating details, and unique flavor combinations. Salare is an eclectic restaurant that features America's diverse culture of food. It's dishes are influenced by South America, Africa, Europe, and the Caribbean Islands. The Steelhead Trout Ceviche's spicy kick was a great accompaniment to its vibrant colors made possible by its wild apple mead, avocado, and chili paste base. The duck was some of the best we've ever had, as the common gaminess of duck didn't come through at all and was evenly cooked all throughout. Definitely interested in coming back to Salare for brunch!\",\n",
       "   'A nice and cozy restaurant that\\'s on a more high end side; good for dinner dates or special occasions. Amazing service! Would love to give them a 5 star review but we were kind of disappointed with the food...Small Bites:Crispy potatoes, delicata squash, almonds & parmesan fondue | Perfectly fried wedged potatoes, but unfortunately too salty for us...the chef seasoned the potatoes a bit too much, and we\\'re definitely overwhelmed with the addition of parmesan fondue.Brussels sprouts, jalapeños, cilantro & coconut curry | Super sour and heavy on salt as well \\xa0Would not have finish this if it weren\\'t for the coconut curry, which added a mild and sweet flavor that covered uthat sourness... Entrées:Sturgeon (coconut milk \"rundown\", piklitz & plantains) | One of the best dishes tonight! After the disappointing appetizers, the seared sturgeon made our palates really happy. The thick \"rundown\" (or concentrated coconut milk) is so flavorful and light, which complemented well with the slightly salted sturgeon! The pickled veggies were too spicy in my opinion, but the plantain chips on the side is such a pleasant treat to eat with the coconut milk purée!Trompetti (squid ink, clams, mussels, \\'nduja sausage, kale & garlic cream) | This italian-cut pasta probably absorbed the sauce a bit too well...the center portion is again too heavy on salt and garlic cream, but the generous amount of clams and mussels made up to the dish!Desserts:Vanilla Bavarian Mousse | The mousse is SO SOFT AND LIGHT, it literally melted in my mouth...The yuzu crème definitely came through but I just wish there were more of it! The vermouth balances out the sweetness pretty well and I just hoped the flavor of the orange blossom chiffon comes through..Tiramisu Entremet | THE best dish of the night. You can literally taste the difference of layers. A mouthful of the spongy chiffon, coffee mousse, and caramel sauce on top of the chcolate cocoa nib tuile was divine. The only letdown would be the macaron since all I can taste was caramel and chocolate...no sign of the espresso:(',\n",
       "   \"I came here with my family to give it a try and I was pleasantly surprised. The space is big, the decor is minimal but tasteful, and the \\xa0service was outstanding. Given that it's fine dining, it's a great place for a date or a celebration.The menu is smaller but rotating, and it tends to focus on seasonal ingredients. While expected, it's a little pricier, with small portions, so don't forget to pregame your dinner with a prior meal/snacks! For my family of 4, we ordered 3 entrees and 3 appetizers and it came out to $42 a person (tax and tip included). The flavor combinations were interesting and unique, but in the best way possible!Focaccia with garlic oil - 5/5 fantastic flavor balance between all the ingredients and the bread came out perfectCauliflower -5/5 \\xa0jerk seasoned cauliflower with creme freshe, apricots, \\xa0and mint. Super unique and great flavor profiles, with the cauliflower being crispy on the outside. Super yum!Crispy potatoes - 3/5 potatoes with honeycrisp apples, over a almond parmesan fondue. While the concepts were great, the serving was beyond tiny, and the potatoes were too salty. Squash ricotta pasta - 5/5 pasta filled with squash and ricotta, while paired with a mushroom almond sauce. Super flavorful, amazing textures, and well balanced flavor profilesDuck - 4/5 duck with crispy skin, seasoned with four spice. Served with pecan bread pudding and cranberry juice. The idea was on point, but the execution was off. The duck was slightly salty, and about 35% of it was overcooked, but the flavors of everything was still perfect!Stergeon - 5/5 stergeon with coconut milk rundown (reminded me of green curry) served with plantains. The fish was moist and it held it shape, the flavors were light but still very complex, and surprisingly, \\xa0the plantains really work with the sauce!\",\n",
       "   \"Lovely experience, they were able to take the meat out of my dish. Delicious food! Great service. I went for brunch with a small group of friends and family, we were all pleased. I would love to come back when I'm in the location.\",\n",
       "   \"Excellent desserts! We had a reservation at 8 and didn't get seated until 8:45 so I knocked a star off since the scallops entree ran out by the time we got seated and I was given sturgeon instead. We ordered the duck, the octopus, and the sturgeon. The duck was the only good entree out of the three. Nice crispy skin and moist center. The fish was dried and the octopus was tough. However, the desserts! The coconut panna cotta with passion fruit is divine! I'd suggest grabbing dinner down the street at Junebaby and come to the bar for dessert. Chef Jordan came by and checked on us and made the experience memorable but the food was anything but.\",\n",
       "   \"I came here to celebrate my cousins 40th with a large group. Everything came out family style. The food was excellent, our favorite being the herb pasta with morels. We had about 6 courses of food served family style. Some items like the pork belly were a little hard to share, especially since we had to split 3 small fried ribs amount 15 people. So that was a little annoying to cut up, I felt like they could have done a better job of that.They are very good at catering to families, they even have diapers in the bathroom! That's a really nice touch! I love that a family could come here and feel comfortable, since it's always hard to go out to a nice restaurant.We also had a few wine pairings and they were super knowledgeable about it. I loved trying them and they were nice enough to let us take pictures of the bottle. I would highly recommend this place for a family dinner! You will feel comfortable and leave very full!!!\",\n",
       "   \"Outstanding seasonal fare. This is a great spot for a date or celebration, as it is pricey. What you're paying for is outstanding service, great food, and the creativity that comes with a great chef and kitchen staff. We came here just because of the head chef and owner, a two times James Beard award winner, and were not disappointed. We loved it all so much we had a hard time picking a favorite dish!\",\n",
       "   'I have eaten dinner at Salare twice, and both meals were delicious and compelling. The food combinations were unusual and inspired! Best fine dining in the Ravenna neighborhood of Seattle, and parking is never an issue.',\n",
       "   \"Best brunch I've had in a decade. No joke. For years I've wanted to come here for my bday dinner but somehow making reservations ahead of time was not my forte and it didn't happen. I finally made one recently for brunch and I am so glad I didn't procrastinate any longer! To start I had a coffee - not your basic diner coffee, but good high quality stuff! Not watered down - thank you! Then we had the unique and intoxicating bloody stone (mary) with guava (how did you know I love love love guava?!?) followed by the orchard - this drink left an impression in my mouth for hours after leaving the restaurant. I can't say I have had that experience before in a restaurant! What an amazing concoction!For brunch I had the burrata - a delicate dance of oozy mozzarella with pesto aioli, picked onions, mint, and falafel. I loved every bite and was so satiated I didn't even finish the bread that came with it. I know, the dish was THAT good. My brunching partner had the feijoada - the plating alone was enough to make this pescatarian swoon. I tasted a tiny part of this and was impressed with the nuanced flavors and textures of the dish. I don't dole out 5-stars very often for brunch so this place really wowed me on all fronts. Service was good, the ambiance was warm and inviting - so much so that I didn't realize how blustery it was outside when we left, and the food speaks for itself. Can't wait to return - sometime I will make it in for dinner! It's not far from where I live!\",\n",
       "   \"Meet my friend and fellow Elite Yelper Marie B here last Wednesday for dinner. She has frequented Junebaby since it opened but this was her visit to Salare. It was nice and easy to get to via bus since I was meeting her and coming in from Pioneer Square. Got there a little early but was seated immediately. Love the space lots of natural light during summer dining, beautiful mural by a friend and artist Dozfy that separates the bar dining space from the dining area towards the back. The menu was up to date with what was online that was nice, some places you get to and it's a totally different menu. I was seated on the bench near the window, my friend was across on an uncomfortable wooden chair. I realize now I should've asked her if she wanted to switch seats. I ordered a cocktail while waiting for her to arrive and had narrowed it down to three the waitress was very informative I ended up going with the Vesperado: Rose \\xa0vodka, gin, rhubarb and Lilet I was trying to stay away from something too sweet this did the trick. My friend started off with Dungeness crab custard appetizer that came with toasted brioche sticks. A big fan of the oxtail at served at Junebaby my friend selected the halibut that was prepared with oxtail bordelaise, bok choy, peanuts & ginger-scallion vinaigrette the skin came crispy creating a very beautiful dish. Fish was cooked perfectly and she loved the sauce I had a taste very delicious the only issue was the bok choy was a little too el dente for her. The scallop risotto is what was calling me when I looked at the menu online and I stayed with it prepared with \\xa0Calabrian chili, cilantro, agretti and X.O. sauce. Perfectly cooked, scallops were mixed in the dish itself and the X.O. sauce was perfectly balanced didn't cover up the flavor of the scallops. I ended the meal with the other item I had my eye on the Pavlova Trifle: coconut meringue crumble, passionfruit crémeux, mint granita & mascarpone cream. Loved the texture and flavors the mascarpone wasn't my favorite part of the dish but that's a personal taste on my side. I had given my friend a gift for her birthday last month and the waitress added a candle to the dessert to celebrate her nice touch. Had a wonderful evening visiting with my friend and our water glasses were never empty. Another wonderful meal at a Chef Edouardo establishment. Looking forward to my next visit to his impeccably managed restaurants.\",\n",
       "   \"Salare was fantastic. It may be my new favorite modern American cuisine in Seattle, overtaking Lark in Capitol Hill. The dishes were original, vibrant and beautifully prepared.The salmon rillettes appetizer when phenomenal and the burrata was surprising, unexpected and hearty (falafel with burrata, who would have thought?)We ordered the special (beef ribs) which were huge (and ended up being eaten for three different meals) and were perfectly fall-off-the-bone prepared.The desserts were also a standout \\xa0(I personally love the pavlova in mousse but my wife preferred the cheesecake).We were absolutely stuffed by the end of dinner but loved every bite. We'll be coming back here a lot more frequently\",\n",
       "   \"I vacillated between four and five stars. What pushed me to five stars was the realization of what chef Edouardo Jordan was trying to accomplish here.Salare is a fusion of his southern (Florida) roots, his African heritage, and his training and accomplishments at such diverse places as Italy (learning charcuterie), The French Laundry, Per Se, The Herbfarm, Sitka & Spruce, and Bar Sajor. What a fusion!The food here is incredible and creative. This place will challenge your palate--even for what you thought was going to be a typical preparation of some main ingredient you were familiar with. The other ingredients and the spicing in the dish (not to mention the preparation techniques) are likely to bring flavor combinations you've never experienced before to your palate. That's a good thing. Different can be good. Relax and enjoy.Always up for a challenge to my palate, I tried the tripe with porcini mushrooms, nantes carrots, chickpeas, and hen egg. The spicing whispered of influences from both Africa and The French Laundry. It was piquant and mildly peppery, creamy and varied in texture at the same time, and completely delightful. I've had many preparations of tripe around the world, and this was the best I have tasted. It was also very filling.My dining companions both had the sliced ribeye, with baby potatoes, padrón peppers, beets, and horseradish ricotta. That was also a tasty dish, with an exotic mix of spices on the meat.We passed on appetizers this trip to try the desserts. The spiced squash sorbet was good, with both some familiar and some inventive spicing. The roasted pumpkin crème brûlée (with cinnamon madrona crème fraîche, pepita bark, candied squash, and maple bacon macaron) was among the best crème brûlées I've had, and the various flavors all blended well. The pavlova (with spiced pears, buttermilk granita, lemon thyme curd, fromage blanc mousse, and fig sherbet) was a smorgasbord of pleasing desserts one one plate. And the plum upside-down cake (with plum wine grenade, peach caramel, brown butter streusel, and lemon verbena ice cream) was the star of the desserts, and one of the most amazing tasting and palate pleasing desserts I've ever had.Portion sizes are reasonable, neither huge nor tiny. Just right really, given the unique taste combinations you will experience.It's easy to see why Edouardo Jordan won the 2018 James Beard award in May as Best Chef: Northwest for his work here. (His newer restaurant, JuneBaby, is just down the street. It won the 2018 James Beard award for the Best New Restaurant in the USA.)We will definitely be returning to try more of this food. And you should too. Especially if you can't get in to JuneBaby. The difference is Salare is African-influenced fusion. JuneBaby is pure, straight-on African-influenced Southern USA food. And Salare is larger and takes reservations for all party sizes. You can't miss with either.\",\n",
       "   'We went to Salare for a birthday celebration and it was perfect! Every bite was a new flavor and I loved the house made walnut liquor!',\n",
       "   \"We had a reservation, they were running late. Fine we understood and we're patient. Ordered two drinks, waited five minutes and they told us they didn't have ingredients anymore. Ok it was day after valentines we get it ordered something else. Finally get our table, they're out of the appetizers we wanted. Ok got something else. The food we did get was amazing, I won't deny that we enjoyed it all. We asked for our check, got it and it was completely wrong like not even close and they said oh we got some stuff mixed up sorry. So fine they went back and we get the second one except it's wrong again. So again we complain and they go back and fix it bring it back, the wine i ordered was still wrong on the menu but we were so fed up that we just paid to leave. What bugged me the most was it was gratuity was included which frankly wasn't deserved and they never even offered to give us anything for the complete disaster of a night they gave us. We paid full price for a mess essentially. The food was good but we won't be returning.\",\n",
       "   'This was such a treat! Top items 1. Fennel soda2. Yogurt lemon curd kiwi and granola3. Rice bowlEverything on the menu was well thought out and reasonably priced- will go again!',\n",
       "   \"Exquisite meal. Everything was delicately prepared and well balanced. The service was prompt, clean, and efficient. We sat at the Chef's Counter which was a treat - we could see everything! \\xa0They check every single plate twice before it goes out and taste test everything. We got the Golden Bert Gazpacho, cauliflower and grilled haloumi, agnolotti pasta, and the rib eye. Everything was amazing but the pasta by far was our favorite - it was creamy, had some crunch, and was so soft - melts in your mouth! We can't wait to return.\",\n",
       "   'Talk about consistency: I\\'ve eaten here three times now and each time they get full marks from me. \\xa0This kitchen knows how to cook. \\xa0I\\'m already thinking of ways to get my fiance to bring me back.This time we tried their \"bites\", which were actually bigger than expected. \\xa0The sweetbreads with madeira Mushrooms and tardivo ($11) were flavorful and perfect for splitting between two people. \\xa0There were actually probably at least four bites on that dish, if not five.We also tried the trout turnover ($11) because it sounded so interesting. \\xa0It was a savory little pie which was sweetened with some peperonata. \\xa0I loved it.For our main dishes, we ate the casarecce ($19) and the pork belly ($26).As always, they knocked it out of the park with their pasta. \\xa0Seriously, I told my fiance we should maybe just ordered another pasta dish for dessert because the kitchen always makes it such a pleasure to eat. \\xa0This time, their pork fennel sausage, combination with tomatoes and eggplant managed to pack a spicy punch that had my fiance raving about it for a good couple of hours afterwards.The pork belly was also very well executed, and perfectly paired with crisp cauliflower, tender cipollini onions, and some fragrant vinaigrette.We did end up ordering two sweet desserts. \\xa0Their yuzu creme brulee ($11) was served in their typical fashion with ice cream and a macaron. \\xa0Delicious combination of textures and flavors. \\xa0I would buy that pepita bark to each on its own!The chocolate bomb ($12) was our other dessert and it was the first time I didn\\'t really like something from the kitchen. \\xa0Part of the base was a banana mousse, which was so heavily banana flavored that I just didn\\'t like it. \\xa0I should mention that I\\'m not really a banana person. \\xa0The dark chocolate, peanut caramel, and crunchy feuilletine were enjoyable though.Other fun things to note: they have static guard in the bathroom. So thoughtful. Also free diapers. And they have a kids menu that has easy to like foods and VEGETABLES, so it\\'s actually fairly healthy, which is nice.We also loved watching the kitchen work, and we like knowing that all the staff gets fairly paid with the tip that is included in the bill. \\xa0And whoever is making the pate de fruits that comes with the check... we love that touch! \\xa0Such a nice palate cleanser. \\xa0We will absolutely keep coming back for more of everything.',\n",
       "   \"Came here for the second time on a Sunday night for an early dinner with my fiance. We were able to make same day reservations online and opted to sit kitchenside as we did last time because we love watching the action.Service as always was great, and we loved the recommendations from our waiter.We decided to share 4 savory dishes:- Grilled parsnips with bosc pear slices, tart cherry sauce, lemony yogurt sauce, fresh watercress, and peanuts ($15). Stellar combination of flavors. Loved the way they cooked the parsnips, and who'd have guessed peanuts go so well with parsnips?- Tripe with porcini mushrooms, carrots, chickpeas, and an egg ($21). This was fall comfort food at its finest. The very first bite had us dropping our jaws in amazement at the savory deliciousness. I'd order this again in a heartbeat, and it was an excellent recommendation from our waiter. We also got two slices of toasted country bread gifted to us by the chef, for soaking up the fantastic sauce. I would come back again and again for this.- Pork loin with einkorn ragout, spinach, hazelnuts, and sage ($26). Another excellent dish. The pork was perfectly cooked and seasoned. Each bite was moist and flavorful and the nutty ragout was a discovery.- Casoncelli, which is a stuffed pasta, filled with a beet and mild cheese, and paired with chanterelles and sprinkled with crushed crispy chicken skin pieces ($19). I don't know what to say, except this place really knows how to make pasta.For dessert, we ordered the Pavlova at the recommendation of our waiter, and the Smore.The pavlova has a very light, airy meringue with buttermilk granita, fig sherbet (the fig flavor here was a little light), fresh strawberries, delicious lemon curd. It was good, and I don't even normally like meringues.The Smore dessert came with this dense chocolate cashew brownie, delicious chocolate brandy caramel, heavenly coffee mousse, and very fragrant hazelnut ice cream. We both really loved this dessert, and I also don't like smores.Once again, the kitchen wowed us, and we loved our experience. We will be back soon!\",\n",
       "   \"Came here on Mother's day for dinner with my boyfriend (neither of our mothers live in town) after when we couldn't get into Junebaby.We were in the very first seating as we were the first ones in line, having arrived around 4:20ish, before doors open. \\xa0We got two seats at the kitchen side, which is like sitting at the bar, except you get to see the chefs in action. \\xa0And Edouardo Jordan was there that day, so that was pretty cool.My boyfriend decided to start with the Piperita cocktail ($13) which has Tequila, Brine, Sherry, Calabrian Chili, and Lemon. \\xa0It had a lot of character and wasn't too sweet or too sour; a good balance of flavors. \\xa0We both enjoyed the little kick from the chili.I asked the bartender to make me a dink with blackberry shrub and tequila. \\xa0He flavored it with lime, fire bitters, and some extra chili powder and salt ($13), which I really enjoyed.For our meal, we shared three plates: the burrata, the cavatelli, and the duck.The burrata ($16) was served with fennel, fiddlehead ferns, sourdough melba & red bell pepper jus. \\xa0I loooved the sweet bell pepper jus and the mellow, faintly salty, very creamy burrata. \\xa0I'm not normally a cheese person, but this dish was perfectly executed.The squid ink cavatelli ($19) came out looking like cute little pill bugs on our plate. \\xa0It was served with calamari, calabrian chili, lardo & preserved lemon. \\xa0The flavor of everything was fantastic and the cavatelli was so perfectly al dente, it knocked our socks off. \\xa0This was my favorite dish of the night, and it still stands out in my mind as one of the best pasta dishes I've had in a long time.The duck ($27) tasted like it was cooked confit style had delectably crispy skin and was served with quinoa, a silky smooth gizzard puree (I actually thought it was liver), fava beans, rhubarb & sumac yogurt sauce. This was my boyfriend's favorite. \\xa0It was a very generous portion of protein and there wasn't a flaw to the plate.We did see and hear people raving about the gnocchi, but were too full to eat another bite.Nevertheless, we had to order dessert (you can't go out to eat and not order dessert!). \\xa0We split the meyer lemon crème brûlée, which was $10 for a taste of heaven. \\xa0The bright citrus made the dish not feel too rich, and the caramelize sugar crust was perfect. \\xa0I also loved the earl grey macaron. \\xa0An excellent dish to end on.Our check came to us with two little ginger hibiscus pate de fruits to cleanse our palates. \\xa0I really liked this last touch, and the flavor was phenomenal.Overall $129 for three excellent dishes and two good drinks and some very friendly service seemed totally reasonable with us (the 20% gratuity is automatically added on, calculated based on your subtotal before tax). \\xa0Other pros: the handsoap in the bathroom smells like heaven, there were free diaper available which seemed very child-friendly, the parking is always free, and we loved our view of the kitchen. \\xa0We'll be back!\",\n",

       "   \"Truly as good as it gets in terms of 1) ingredients/dish, 2) service, and 3) cost. I've been communicating with Weichy, Salare's Service Director, for a month in preparation for a friend's birthday dinner. She was extremely accommodating, friendly, professional, and inviting. She was open to any and all requests and suggestions I made. Granted, a lot of it would have to come out of my own preparation and effort, but they were open to allowing all of it, but she helped me execute half of it, which made the evening that much more special for our friend. She even called me the day before to give me (my table) the first chance at ordering their seasonal pork shank (butchered freshly in-house) that wasn't even on the menu. We took her up on that offer and I am so glad we did. It was incredible. The braised pork was literally fall-off-the-bone tender.For appetizers, we had the Cougar Gold Cheddar & Chive Biscuit and Salumi & Charcuterie. Both fantastic choices as you'll see by the photo.For dinner, we shared family style with the 1) pork shank (which, again, wasn't on the menu). You'll see by the photo how amazing it looks, and it tasted just as amazing. 2) Cavatelli squid ink pasta. Surprisingly the sauce was very light and tasty. 3) Casarecce pork fennel sausage pasta. Wonderful, classic style pasta. 4) Monkfish with purple savory clams, honey mussels, fennel & bouillabaisse broth. I could probably do without the monk fish ONLY because I'm generally not a fan of fish (let alone monk fish), but I'm all about new experiences, and I can appreciate a good sauce, which this dish had. All in all, absolutely wonderful meal and evening. The service was impeccable and friendly and I will be ever grateful for Salare's hospitality.

I'm not much of a goat lover (except the real fuzzy kind, while they are still frolicking around) nor so much meat in general, so we shared the deep fried whole fish, accompanied by Ugali and Sakuma, the white maize cake, and luscious greens (collards and spinach i think), and the mixed sauteed cabbage and onions, which were velvety and melt in your mouth tender. The fish came with a little cup of coconut curry sauce. The fish, while beautiful, golden and crispy, needed a bit more flavor for my spice hungry palate, but that is likely not the traditional way to serve it. We passed on the Chai and desert fried beignet type doughnuts, but next time we are IN! What a wonderful experience! The only thing that could have been improved was our young server, who seemed checked out and kind of oblivious to checking back, clearing the table, or even to remember to smile. All that said, this was a tremendously beautiful meal and fun experience. Thank you!\",\n",

If you're looking for a hearty meal with great flavor for very little money get here early. Kenyan food is a rare find in any city. We're fortunate to have it here in Seattle.

       "   \"This is by far the best hidden gem I've found in 2019 by a landslide. The food is cheap (Columbia city is usually pricey), amazingly delicious and authentic, while sporting huge portions. The service was warm and welcoming, and the staff & customers were mostly African with their local accents - great sign the food was about to be amazing. I tried a variety of dishes & drinks and they were all so unique in it's own way.Goat: 5/5 Super flavorful and moist, but the only caveat was the meat to bone ratio was poor - standard for goatFried tilapia with curry on the side: 4/5 The tilapia had a great crisp shell and it wasnt dry, with a citrus heavy flavor on the coating. Pilau: 5/5 this side starch dish had a surprising amount of flavor, it reminded me of Indian biryani. Ugali: 2/5 this side starch had a really odd texture, dense moist flavorless cake. Doesn't really fit the menu description and its nothing like cornbread. Sukuma mix: 5/5 this side veggie is a combination of spinach and collard greens, with a faint citrusy & cumin-y note. Cabbage (not on menu): 5/5 this house side veggie was recommended to us by our server and I was not disappointed. It's like an African Cole slaw without the mayo. Uji brown health drink- 3/5 this funky drink is fermented dough that ends up with a plum tasting thicker drink served cold. Interesting and worth a try!Supu-mteta soup: 5/5 this is a savory goat soup served in a mug. This stuff is so flavorful I would totally make a soup out of this with some noodles, meats and veggies. Overall, this spot is my favorite restaurant in the area so far, and I'd highly recommend checking it out! I'd definitely come back to try the other offerings on the menu!\",\n",

Before it was around $24 for two meals and today I paid $35 which again is fine but the food was not good. I'm sad because I really liked this place but now I might not go back\",\n",

We chose to wait; the lady at the register was doing some coordination of tables (though she cautioned us to hurry \"before someone else sat down\"); we ordered and sat at the only free spot. After a few minutes, a large group came in (7 people) and we & another group were asked to shift to a different table to make room.75 minutes later, we hadn\\'t received any food or any indication about when we\\'d get our food. I went to ask how much longer it was going to be; I was told \"4 people are ahead of you\", but no estimate. I asked again for an estimate, and was asked if I wanted to cancel my order, which I did.No apology was ever given.

It was parked outside of the Rooftop brewery and I was so excited to finally be able to give it a try as I've wanted to for along time. We decided to give the kids meal a try for my son and so glad we did. It comes with a side of the jollof rice which has a great flavor of tomatoes & spices mixed with a variety of veggies, plantains that were cooked perfectly and had a great balance of sweet with a little bit of spice. Also we had the choice of a no spicy chicken skewer which I thought was a great idea for the kids and people who don't want that extra kick. The food is made to order so it's fresh and hot when it comes out. Like and food truck or restaurant you have to be patient for your food and enjoy your beer and company while you wait.

I, like most people around me, ordered the combo meal. It is a solid quantity of food for $12: plantains, a small kebab, and joloff rice (rice cooked in a stew). I sprung for a lamb kebab, but your other options are chicken and beef. The plantains were by far the showstopper of the combo: I've never had spiced plantains quite like these before, and thoroughly enjoyed them. The lamb kebab was also great--the meat was very well-seasoned and perfectly cooked. Sadly, the joloff rice was a huge disappointment--it was not at all salted and ended up tasting bland, soggy, and entirely forgettable. Overall, I would probably still get the meal because the healthy portion of plantains and the kebab were both delicious. If only the rice could get on their level...\",\n",

The three of us ordered separately, and since I took longer to decide, there was one person between me and my coworkers to order at the counter. One ordered soup, one the ribs (braised beef was sold out). Everything seemed to take a while. They sat with their numbers to wait for their food.The woman in front of me waited to order. She finally got to, then paid with a credit card. The machine ran out of paper, and the girl behind the counter took about 5 minutes to go get a roll and change it. They were still having problems when I ordered, so I decided to pay in cash to make it easier. The girl at the counter wandered around doing various things, even though I was waiting to order and had cash in my hand. At this point my coworker had already received her soup, and I was just ordering. Finally she took my order, then did a few more things, then eventually went to ring me up and had to ask my order again. I wanted to pay cash to make things faster, but so much for that. My total was $12.17 or something, so I gave her $20 and 17 cents. She couldn't figure out how to calculate the change from that, so just handed me a bunch of change... ok.
